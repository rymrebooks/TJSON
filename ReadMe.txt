	Fastest and steadity
	Long time excutation whithout memory fragmentation.
	Threadsafe.
	General/flexible purpose in use.
	Only string storage for all type values.
	Float point, number, boolean are used as realm/context.
	Suggestion using: each thread should have a TJSON object to use as global util
	Using: just include header file, TJson.h
